# Internet_Infrastructure_in_India_and_the_effect_of_COVID-19
This repository showcases my work on Internet Infrastructural advancement during the COVID-19 era in India. It also analyzes how it affected the life of the youth in the country.

> I started my Data Science journey with this project. During this project, I learned Data Manipulation and Analysis in Python using the Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit Learn Libraries . I also mastered Hicrosoft Excel skills that helped me collect and manage data professionally.

`Today, when I look into this project, I realize how far I have come in less than two years, I am proud. I keep this project untouched as a reminder of the start of my journey, my imperfections, and my lack of experience which motivates me every day to work harder and learn deeper.`


## Data Sources

1) I collected data fron various Internet Providers in India and compiled it into a single CSV file for understanding the Internet Infrastructure (`Quarter `, `Ethernet/LAN`, `Fibre`,
`LTE/FW LTE`, `Total ISP subscribers`, `Wireless Internet`, `Wired Internet`, `Broadband`, `Monthly ARPU`, `Minutes of Internet Usage per month` `Internet Telephony in minutes (in millions)``Wireless Data usage (Gb) per month`, `Cost to subscriber per Gb`) 
2) I did primary data collection by creating a survey that asked for voluntary answering of questions related to Internet Usage Patterns. [See the Questionnaire](Survey.pdf)
